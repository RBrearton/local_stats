Scientific Image Analysis in Python
===================================

:py:mod:`local_stats` is an open-source pacakge for the analysis of scientific
images.
Currently, :py:mod:`islatu` is developed at and supports data from `Diamond
Light Source`_, however we are happy to work with others to enable data from
other sources.

These webpages include `API-level documentation`_ and information about some
`workflows`_ that can be used for data reduction.
